final_dataset_file = './final_dataset.csv'
corporate_trees_directory = './corp_trees/'
ma_data_dir = './ma_data/'

final_dataset = read the final_dataset_file
random_numbers = generate like 50 random numbers between 1 - 50,000
initialize a text file or something to write to, ill call it txt

for each random number:
    fetch that row number from final_dataset
    get the column 'Parent Company', also get columns 'All Transaction Announced Date', 'Company Name', 'Target/Issuer', 'Buyer/Investors'
    there will be 2 searches

    search 1:
    search within corporate_trees_directory for files that have that parent company inside the file name (there should be 3)
    one of the 3 files should have 'Corporate Tree' inside the filename (call this corp tree file)
        inside corp tree file, look at columns 'Company Name' and 'Parent Company', try to find a match to the parent company and company name we fetched from final_dataset 
    if no matches are found, go back to the three files and look for a file with 'Products' in the filename 
        in this products file, there are columns 'Product Name' and 'Company'
        look for match where 'Product Name' == 'Company Name' (from final_dataset) and 'Company' == 'Parent Company' (from final_dataset)
    write whether or not there was a match to be found to txt, if a match is found write entire rows from both files 

    search 2: 
    Within ma_data_dir, each file is titled with a date range, ie. '6-6-2024 to 1-1-2023' (the formatting is an EXACT match, like it will for sure be '[day]-[month]-[year] to [day]-[month]-[year]')
    search for the file where 'All Transaction Announced Date' is within it's titled range 
    for the selected file, there will be a column called 'All Transaction Announced Date' as well. To be able to differentiate, lets call this 'All Transaction Announced Date (1)'
    There will be a ton of rows in this file, but they are sorted by date descending in 'All Transaction Announced Date'
    So, employ binary search to find the rows (note rows plural) that match the 'All Transaction Announced Date' we got from final_dataset
    write the matched rows to the txt file 





# documented issue:
# Applied Energy Recovery Inc is parent of E Tech, but A. O Smith is parent of Applied Energy Recovery Inc
# very hard to know to go to A O Smith corp tree to find this info match
