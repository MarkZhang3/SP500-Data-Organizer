Smiths patented design integrates a tank less engine with a small buffer tank to provide the best performance attributes of both technologies. The NEXT Hybrid water heater performs like a tank less model, but the small buffer tank allows it to overcome some of the negative attributes normally associated with tank less models like minimum flow rates or cold water sandwiches. When a household is using multiple appliances simultaneously, the buffer tank allows the model to provide hot water to the fixtures without reducing the flow rate. To maximize the energy efficiency of the entire system, the exhaust gas from the tank less engine is routed back into the buffer tank in order to extract additional heat into the water."
